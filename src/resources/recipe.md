# Aaron Atkinson's FLL recipe

Aaron was a very successful FLL coach for several years, and he gathered
notes we all took over our years of coaching and compiled them into this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S_PoO1xZpBpp9Pyh_C--IPGe0c-Sd7DPpWIKlxH8F1o/edit?usp=sharing).

Of particular note are the "Core Values", "Innovation Project", "Robot Design", and "Presentation" tab.

Note the "Schedule" tab, which you should copy and paste into your own team's workbook to ensure
you're hitting milestones when you need.

Of course it is up to you to decide how you want to run your team, but these have been useful in the past.

# Aaron's worksheets for Identify and Design phases

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtBpRs4djgG9GuTiWqWU2_tHw7CgeiEc/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386092315922050632&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the workbook with sheets for various purposes.
Overall, the worksheets are helpful tools for getting the kids to think critically about how the
robot should interact with models to earn points, and what type of robot should be built. 
The major idea here is to get the kids to gather data, and make decisions based on the evidence.
Keep the worksheets they've filled out and put them on the big boards for judging. This data-based
decision making will be part of their story in front of judges.

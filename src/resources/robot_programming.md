# Programming a robot

We are using Pybricks Code for the first time this year to program our robots. Our four teams typically share code snippets frequently for commonly-used routines such as line following or squaring off to a line.

If you need your pybricks license, contact Jeremy.

Please consider taking a simple bot home with you and reading through the [pybricks guide](https://pybricks.com/learn/making-programs/basic-robot-navigation/) to get you started!

We also have some simple example scripts that can be dowloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o4VhqPrEOAjG5M4UB7BYrPYEL8G5uTL9?usp=drive_link)
and read into pybricks' web interface to help get you started.

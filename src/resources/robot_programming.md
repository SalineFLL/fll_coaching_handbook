# Programming a robot

We are using Pybricks Code for the first time this year to program our robots. Our four teams typically share code snippets frequently for commonly-used routines such as line following or squaring off to a line.

Please consider taking a simple bot home with you and reading through the [pybricks guide](https://pybricks.com/learn/making-programs/basic-robot-navigation/) to get you started!

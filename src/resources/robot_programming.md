# Programming a robot

We are using Pybricks Code for the first time this year to program our robots.

[Pybricks code](https://code.pybricks.com)

You can find your team's pybricks licence [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wmigIlWk96c4rZnW1iBS2owpAYb45o1G9LGGEaVASCU/edit?usp=sharing). All coaches should have "Viewer" permissions, so if you do not have permission to view the file, contact Jeremy to get it.

Please consider taking a simple bot home with you and reading through the [pybricks guide](https://pybricks.com/learn/making-programs/basic-robot-navigation/) to get you started!

We also have some simple example scripts that can be dowloaded from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o4VhqPrEOAjG5M4UB7BYrPYEL8G5uTL9?usp=drive_link)
and read into pybricks' web interface to help get you started.

Our four teams typically share code snippets frequently for commonly-used routines such as line following or squaring off to a line.
Please upload useful routines your team designs to the google drive above if you think the other three teams would benefit from them!

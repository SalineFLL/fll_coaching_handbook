# Reimbursement of Expenses

Coaches can be reimbursed for team-related expenses and should expect to spend between tens to low-hundreds of dollars on supplies for the Innovation Project.

**Important:** You cannot be reimbursed for tax. If you wish to make a tax-free purchase, please contact Jeremy Schroeder at saline.fll@gmail.com. He can work with the school to facilitate the purchase, which can result in significant savings.

To get reimbursed, follow this [instruction guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J5_JL-qSNJ7KT6zkuzKE9uRd_LXk8GHVqH9z-9O438A/edit?usp=sharing).

# Maintaining Shared Space

All of the following are tasks we expect coaches to delegate to the teammates. They must learn to take care of our equipment and space, and this is fundamental to that learning.

## Team/coach clean-up checklist

- [ ] All trash and recycling generated during practice cleaned up
- [ ] All LEGO put in correct storage bins
- [ ] All club computers placed into vertical rack in roll-up cabinet
- [ ] All charging cables neatly wrapped and in roll-up cabinet
- [ ] 1 Team art supplies container on correct shelf along back wall of storage room
- [ ] 2 Team bins on correct shelf along back wall of storage room
- [ ] Robot game boads placed against wall in robotics room
- [ ] If not taking your team's robot home to experiment, robot is charging on top shelf of roll-up cabinet
- [ ] Lock roll-up cabinet
- [ ] Lock storage room door
- [ ] Lock robotics room door from hallway
- [ ] Leave, dream about robots tonight

### Team Bins

At the end of each practice, it is the responsibility of the coaches to ensure that their team's two designated bins are neatly placed on their assigned shelves in the storage room. While teammates should be encouraged to perform these cleanup tasks, coaches must verify that the space is left organized. 
In the past, the shared space has become disorganized, creating frustration for everyone. Responsible management of our shared space is critical.

### Robot Game Boards

The robot game boards must be neatly lined up against the wall for the robotics room at the end of practice.

### Computers

Computers must be placed neatly in their vertical storage slots, and their charging cables either plugged into the laptops, or neaty wrapped and placed in the roll-up cabinet in the robotics room.

### LEGO

All unused LEGO is picked up, including off the floors, and placed in the **correct yellow container** of the cart we use to move LEGO.

### Robots

Robots should be stored on the top shelf of the roll-up cabinet in the robotics room.

### Locking Up

If you are the last coach with a key leaving for the evening, you must lock the storage room and the robotics room on your way out of the school

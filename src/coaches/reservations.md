# Reserving the Media Center for Extra Practices

To reserve the middle school media center for extra practices (usually on Saturdays), please determine the desired dates and times as early as possible. Email Laurie Dawson (dawsonl@salineschools.org) with a list of all requested dates and times, along with the names of the adults and children who will be present. Laurie will confirm the reservations or let you know if the space is unavailable.

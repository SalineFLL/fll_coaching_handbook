# Youth Protection and Two-Deep Mentorship

The safety and well-being of our students are our highest priority. To create a safe and accountable environment, we adhere to a strict two-deep mentorship policy. All coaches are required to follow these guidelines without exception.

### Two-deep Mentorship

Under no circumstances should a coach ever be alone with either a single student, or a group of students. There must always be at least two adults present. This policy protects both the students and our volunteer coaches.

### Texting

Many students have their own cell phones and may attempt to text you. Although, as a matter of practice, texting directly with teammates is to be discouraged, if this does happen, you must let their parent and the child know that any texts to or from the child must have the parent on the text thread as well. As a matter of principle, if a parent and child are both on the text thread, this is fine. But again, as a matter of practice, texting directly with a teammate is discouraged.

### Handling Private Conversations

There may be times when you need to have a private conversation with a student, such as for a reprimand or to discuss a sensitive issue. To maintain transparency and safety, these conversations must be handled in one of two ways:

1.  **In the Open:** The discussion can take place in an area set apart from the main group but still in full view of the other people in the media center.
2.  **With a Second Adult:** If more privacy is required, you may use one of the glass rooms at the back of the media center. However, a second adult must accompany you and the student into the room.

### Drop-Off and Pick-Up Procedures

To ensure the two-deep mentorship rule is followed from the very start of practice, coaches must enforce the following drop-off procedure:

* **Parent Escort:** Parents must walk their child into the media center at drop-off.
* **Confirming Two Adults:** The parent must verify that at least two coaches are present before they leave.
* **Parent Must Wait:** If a parent arrives and only one coach is present, the parent is required to stay until a second coach or another designated adult arrives.

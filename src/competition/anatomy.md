# Anatomy of a Competition Day

FLL competitions are high-energy, all-day events that are both challenging and incredibly fun. Hereâ€™s what you and your team can expect:

* **Arrival and Pit Setup:** Teams arrive early in the morning to check in and set up their "pit" area. This is their home base for the day, where they can practice, make adjustments to their robot, and relax between judging sessions and matches.

* **Judging Sessions:** Teams will participate in three judged sessions:
    * **Innovation Project:** A 5-minute presentation to a panel of judges about their research and proposed solution.
    * **Robot Design:** A presentation and discussion with judges about the team's robot design, programming, and strategy.
    * **Core Values:** While there isn't a separate presentation for Core Values, they are assessed throughout the other judging sessions and during interactions at the competition.

* **Robot Game Matches:** Teams will compete in several 2.5-minute robot game matches throughout the day. The goal is to score as many points as possible by having their autonomous robot complete missions on the game field.

* **Lunch and Downtime:** There will be a break for lunch, and teams will have downtime between their scheduled activities. This is a great time to see what other teams have done and to practice.

* **Awards Ceremony:** The day concludes with an awards ceremony where teams are recognized for their achievements in the various judged areas and robot game performance.

**Competition Dates:**
* **Regional Competition:** Typically held on the first or second Saturday in December.
* **State Competition:** For advancing teams, this is usually held during the second or third weekend of December.

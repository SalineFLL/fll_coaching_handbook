### Core Values

For the 2024 season, Core Values are assessed during the Innovation Project and Robot Design judging sessions. The following criteria from those rubrics are also counted toward the Core Values award:

* **From Innovation Project:** Design (teamwork), Iterate (sharing), Communicate (celebrating progress)
* **From Robot Design:** Design (collaboration), Communicate (celebrating progress)

Additionally, Gracious Professionalism is judged at the robot game table.

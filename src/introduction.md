# Introduction

Welcome to the Saline FIRST Robotics community, and thank you for volunteering to coach a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Challenge team. Coaching is a significant commitment, but we are confident that you will find it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. As FIRST co-founder Dean Kamen said, “We’re not building robots, we’re using robots to build kids.”

While our Saline FLL teams are often fiercely competitive, and enjoy a high degree of success at regional and state competitions, our primary goal is to teach children that they can achieve anything by identifying a meaningful problem, creating a solid plan, and working diligently with a dedicated team.

Central to the FLL experience are the FIRST Core Values. These values are the guiding principles that shape our program and are crucial for every team to embrace.

### FIRST Core Values

* **Discovery:** We explore new skills and ideas.
* **Innovation:** We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
* **Impact:** We apply what we learn to improve our world.
* **Inclusion:** We respect each other and embrace our differences.
* **Teamwork:** We are stronger when we work together.
* **Fun:** We enjoy and celebrate what we do!

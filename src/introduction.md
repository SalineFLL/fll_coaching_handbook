# Introduction

Welcome to the Saline FIRST Robotics community, and thank you for volunteering to coach a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Challenge team. Coaching is a significant commitment, but we are confident that you will find it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. As FIRST co-founder Dean Kamen said, “We’re not building robots, we’re using robots to build kids.”

While our Saline FLL teams are often fiercely competitive, and enjoy a high degree of success at regional and state competitions, our primary goal is to teach children that they can achieve anything by identifying a meaningful problem, creating a solid plan, and working diligently with a dedicated team.

Central to the FLL experience are the FIRST Core Values. These values are the guiding principles that shape our program and are crucial for every team to embrace.

### FIRST Core Values

* **Discovery:** We explore new skills and ideas.
* **Innovation:** We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.
* **Impact:** We apply what we learn to improve our world.
* **Inclusion:** We respect each other and embrace our differences.
* **Teamwork:** We are stronger when we work together.
* **Fun:** We enjoy and celebrate what we do!
* **Gracious Professionalism:** We encourage high quality work, emphasize the value of others, and respect individuals and the community.

### FIRST competition types

FIRST has several different types of competitions, and their similar naming can be confusing. Here's a quick overview of the distinctions in [Michigan](https://firstinmichigan.us/). Other states, and indeed, other nations, have different age ranges that are included in each competition.

* FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Discover - Preschool
* FLL Explore (FLL-E) - Kindergarten through 3rd grade
* FLL Challenge (FLL-C) - 4th-5th grade
* FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) - 6th-8th grade, no LEGO here
* FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) - High school, big, fast, expensive robots

### Saline's competition types

At Saline we currently have one FLL-E team, comprising 2nd and 3rd graders. We have four FLL-C teams, four FTC teams, and one FRC team.

### FLL teams

The FLL team names are:

* RoboBuzz (FLL-E)
* RoboHornets
* RoboSting
* RoboHive
* RoboSwarm

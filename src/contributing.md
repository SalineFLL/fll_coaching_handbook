As a club, we need this handbook to be as useful as possible. Our goal is to help all coaches, especially new coaches, to recognize and locate resources they'll need to help the kids feel successful and learn. 
While it is unavoidably true that FLL coaching is a lot of work, we want out coaches to feel well-supported and well-prepared, and to help them carry out their responsibilities with as little extra work as possible.
So, reach out whenever you find yourself thinking, "I wish I knew..."

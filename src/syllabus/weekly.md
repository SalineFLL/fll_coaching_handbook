# FLL Weekly Practice Structure for Coaches

## Overview: Structuring the Season with Three Phases

To help teams stay on track and ensure steady progress, practices should follow this three-phase program. Each phase builds on the previous one and gradually introduces more advanced concepts in robot design, coding, mission strategy, and the innovation project. This structure helps avoid last-minute cramming and promotes meaningful learning and teamwork. At the same time, teams should work consistently on Core Values, the Big Board (see section [Judging sesson information](../competition/rubrics.md) for Big Board description), and Presentation Skills, which are integrated throughout all phases.

## Phase 1: Team Foundations & Robot Basics

### Goals:
* Build team chemistry and introduce FLL expectations.
* Teach how practices work, including setup/cleanup and where materials are stored.
* Introduce and reinforce:
    * FLL Core Values
    * Continuous Innovation Loop:
        * Identify – Understand the problem or challenge
        * Design – Brainstorm and plan a solution
        * Create – Build or implement the solution
        * Iterate – Test, evaluate, and improve
        * Communicate – Share results, progress, and ideas
* Begin construction of the LEGO game board stations.
* Build a simple, square robot base:
    * Compact design for maneuverability
    * Drive motors on the bottom
    * Accessory motors mounted on top
* Introduce basic coding concepts (e.g., block coding or early Pybricks logic).

## Phase 2: Coding & Mission Strategy

### Goals:
* Advance coding skills with a focus on Pybricks programming.
* Explore each mission station:
    * Understand scoring opportunities
    * Begin strategic planning—missions to target and in what order.
* Discuss competition rules:
    * 2.5-minute run time
    * How the team interacts with the robot and board during a match.
* Start designing and testing attachments for selected missions.
* Apply the Continuous Innovation Loop:
    * Identify – Challenges with movement or accuracy
    * Design – Attachments or changes
    * Create – New code or hardware
    * Iterate – Testing and adjustments
    * Communicate – Share ideas and results

## Phase 3: Refinement & Optimization

### Goals:
* Optimize robot design, attachments, and code for accuracy and consistency.
* Improve point scoring strategy and mission execution.
* Run practice matches to simulate competition conditions.
* Fine-tune attachment switching and pit crew roles to save time.
* Use the Continuous Innovation Loop regularly:
    * Identify – What needs improvement
    * Design – A solution or change
    * Create – The update in code or hardware
    * Iterate – Testing and refining
    * Communicate – Success or remaining needs

## Ongoing Throughout All Phases

### Core Values:
* Assign each student one of the six values to champion.
* Recite and reflect on values during team discussions.
* Reinforce behavior that demonstrates Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork, and Fun.

### Big Board:
* Create a two-sided visual display showing both the robot game and the innovation project.
* Represent the Continuous Innovation Loop visually:
    * Identify, Design, Create, Iterate, Communicate
* Use pictures, notes, sketches, and documentation from actual practices.

### Presentation Skills:
* Draft and refine team speeches for judging.
* Ensure every student has a role and practices public speaking.
* Prepare for judge Q&A with mock interviews.

### Continuous Innovation Loop:
* Encourage every activity (robot work, coding, innovation project, and presentations) to follow these five steps:
    * Identify
    * Design
    * Create
    * Iterate
    * Communicate
* Reinforce that this loop is not linear—teams should revisit steps as needed.

### Notebook Journaling for Big Board:
* Every student should keep a practice notebook.
* Encourage frequent notes, sketches, code logs, and diagrams.
* These will become critical source material for the Big Board display and help students explain what they did and why.

# Code of Conduct

All team members are expected to adhere to the Saline Heritage Elementary FIRST LEGO League Code of Conduct. If a team member consistently causes issues or repeatedly fails to comply with the Code of Conduct, coaches have the authority to call parents for early pickup from practice, suspend the child from practice, or, in serious cases, expel the teammate from the team.

By the end of the second week of practice, all parents and teammates must read, sign, and return the Code of Conduct.

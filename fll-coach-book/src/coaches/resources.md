# Managing Resources

Our club has a significant collection of LEGOs for teams to use. However, with four teams sharing these resources, coaches must ensure their team is using only its fair share. Last season, we ran out of black pins, which should never happen. Please monitor your team's use of shared LEGOs.

Each team is entitled to the following:
* Two Spike Prime hubs
* Four small motors
* Four large motors
* Four light sensors

Please do not use more than your allotted share of these items.

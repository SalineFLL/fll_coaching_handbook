<p>Welcome to the Saline FIRST Robotics community, and thank you for volunteering to coach a FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Challenge team. Coaching is a significant commitment, but we are confident that you will find it to be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. As FIRST co-founder Dean Kamen famously said, “We’re not building robots, we’re using robots to build kids.”</p>
<p>While our Saline FLL teams often enjoy fierce competition and success, our primary goal is to teach children that they can achieve anything by identifying a meaningful problem, creating a solid plan, and working diligently with a dedicated team.</p>
<p>Central to the FLL experience are the FIRST Core Values. These values are the guiding principles that shape our program and are crucial for every team to embrace.</p>
<h3 id="first-core-values"><a class="header" href="#first-core-values">FIRST Core Values</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery:</strong> We explore new skills and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We use creativity and persistence to solve problems.</li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> We apply what we learn to improve our world.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion:</strong> We respect each other and embrace our differences.</li>
<li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> We are stronger when we work together.</li>
<li><strong>Fun:</strong> We enjoy and celebrate what we do!</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="starting-your-team"><a class="header" href="#starting-your-team">Starting Your Team</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the new season! One of your first tasks as a coach is to reach out to the parents of your team members. This initial communication is crucial for setting expectations and ensuring a smooth and successful season.</p>
<p>You'll need to inform parents about the weekly practice schedule, emphasizing that these are required and will start promptly. It's also important to give them a heads-up about potential competition dates. While we won't know the exact dates until mid-season, they should be advised to keep the first and second weekends of December available.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to explain that while the weekly practices are mandatory, there will be several optional extra practices throughout the season. These sessions are designed to help the team be more competitive and feel a sense of accomplishment by the end of the season.</p>
<h3 id="sample-welcome-email"><a class="header" href="#sample-welcome-email">Sample Welcome Email</a></h3>
<p>Here is a sample email you can adapt and send to your team's parents. Remember to replace the bracketed information with your specific details.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Subject: Welcome to the [Team Name] FIRST LEGO League Team!</strong></p>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>Welcome to the [Year] FIRST LEGO League season! We are the coaches for the [Team Name], and we are thrilled to have your child on our team. Our names are [Coach Name(s)] and you can reach us at [Coach Email(s) and/or Phone Number(s)].</p>
<p>This season promises to be an exciting journey of discovery, teamwork, and fun. We will be holding mandatory weekly practices on <strong>[Day of the week] from [Start Time] to [End Time]</strong> at Saline Heritage Elementary. Practices will begin promptly, so please ensure your child arrives on time.</p>
<p>While we do not have the exact dates for the competitions yet, they typically occur in early December. Please pencil in the <strong>first and second weekends of December</strong> for the regional competition. Should our team advance, the state competition is usually held on the second or third weekend of December.</p>
<p>Throughout the season, we will schedule several <strong>optional extra practices</strong>. These are not required but are highly encouraged to help the team be as prepared and successful as possible. We will provide more details on these as the season progresses.</p>
<p>Our primary goal is to foster a love of learning and problem-solving in a collaborative and supportive environment. We will be guided by the FIRST Core Values, and we expect all team members to do the same.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to a fantastic season with your children!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>[Your Name(s)]
Coaches, [Team Name]</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>From Innovation Project:</strong> Design (teamwork), Iterate (sharing), Communicate (celebrating progress)</li>
<li><strong>From Robot Design:</strong> Design (collaboration), Communicate (celebrating progress)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Gracious Professionalism is judged at the robot game table.</p>

<p>This syllabus outlines the major milestones for the FLL season.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late August:</strong> Season Kickoff! Teams are formed, and coaches receive their rosters. Coaches should contact their teams to introduce themselves and establish a regular practice schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Week of August 25:</strong> First practices. Focus on team-building activities and introduce the annual challenge. Begin brainstorming for the Innovation Project.</li>
<li><strong>September 3, 7:00-8:00 PM:</strong> Expert interview with Natalie Abell, a professor of archaeology at the University of Michigan. All available teammates and coaches should attend, as this is a prime opportunity to learn about potential problems for the Innovation Project.</li>
<li><strong>September:</strong> Continue to work on the Innovation Project and begin building and programming the robot.</li>
<li><strong>October:</strong> Develop and refine the robot's design and programming. Finalize the Innovation Project and prepare the presentation.</li>
<li><strong>November:</strong> Practice, practice, practice! Run the robot on a practice table, refine the project presentation, and ensure all team members are confident in their roles.</li>
<li><strong>Early December (Typically the first or second Saturday):</strong> Regional Competition.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-December (Typically the second or third weekend):</strong> State Competition (for advancing teams).</li>

<p>This section outlines the expectations for coaches, including managing resources, maintaining shared spaces, and other administrative responsibilities.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="maintaining-shared-space"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-shared-space">Maintaining Shared Space</a></h1>
<p>At the end of each practice, it is the responsibility of the coaches to ensure that their team's two designated bins are neatly placed on their assigned shelves in the storage room. While teammates should be encouraged to perform these cleanup tasks, coaches must verify that the space is left organized. Last season, the shared space became disorganized, creating frustration for everyone. Responsible management of our shared space is critical.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="managing-resources"><a class="header" href="#managing-resources">Managing Resources</a></h1>
<p>Our club has a significant collection of LEGOs for teams to use. However, with four teams sharing these resources, coaches must ensure their team is using only its fair share. Last season, we ran out of black pins, which should never happen. Please monitor your team's use of shared LEGOs.</p>
<p>Each team is entitled to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two Spike Prime hubs</li>
<li>Four small motors</li>
<li>Four large motors</li>
<li>Four light sensors</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not use more than your allotted share of these items.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reimbursement-of-expenses"><a class="header" href="#reimbursement-of-expenses">Reimbursement of Expenses</a></h1>
<p>Coaches can be reimbursed for team-related expenses and should expect to spend between tens to low-hundreds of dollars on supplies for the Innovation Project.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You cannot be reimbursed for tax. If you wish to make a tax-free purchase, please contact Jeremy Schroeder at saline.fll@gmail.com. He can work with the school to facilitate the purchase, which can result in significant savings.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reserving-the-media-center"><a class="header" href="#reserving-the-media-center">Reserving the Media Center</a></h1>
<p>To reserve the middle school media center for extra practices (usually on Saturdays), please determine the desired dates and times as early as possible. Email Laurie Dawson (dawsonl@salineschools.org) with a list of all requested dates and times, along with the names of the adults and children who will be present. Laurie will confirm the reservations or let you know if the space is unavailable.</p>
